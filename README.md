# Front-end : JS
The front-end is coded is pure javascript 
Every files manage a web page
and can use the shared file in the racine : marginSite

## lesson learned 
I take a big step in architecture.
it was a really big project and i try it to be the best possible.
The front-end need a better structure however.
Learning a framework can be a good idea.
